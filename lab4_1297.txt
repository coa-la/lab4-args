The main idea is to get the max length of a substring with Palindrome
* Have two type of palindrome substring:
- xxxxaxxxxx -> even length
we loop from 0 -> length of the string:
      if you find any palindrome substring past_position and next_position -> add +1 to check the length on both sides.
- xxxxxxxxx   -> odd length
      if you find any palindrome substring curr_position and next_position -> add +1 to check the length on both sides.
 Get the max length of the substring if with both, print first position
